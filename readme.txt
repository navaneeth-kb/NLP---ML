What is NLP?
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It involves teaching computers to understand and generate human language, such as English, Spanish, or any other language.

Text Processors:
1)Pre-Processing Steps of Text
2)Bag of Words (BoW)
3)One-Hot Encoding
3)TF-IDF
4)Word2Vec
5)RNN Architecture (Recurrent Neural Networks)
6)LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
7)BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)
8)BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Image Processors:
1)CNN Architecture (Convolutional Neural Networks)

Both Text and Image Processors:
1)BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) â€“ Primarily a text processor but can be used in conjunction with CNNs for multimodal tasks.
